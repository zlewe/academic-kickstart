I am a future researcher/engineer who is looking forward to enter the robotics field specialising in Autonomous Robots and Artificial Intelligence.

I have experiences in robotics competitions such as NRC (Malaysian regional WRO), and DARPA Sub-Terranean Challenge. I am currently doing undergraduate research works under Assistive Robotics Group in NCTU, Taiwan.
