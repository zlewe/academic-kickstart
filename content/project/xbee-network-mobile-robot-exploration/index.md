### Abstract
In DARPA SubT Challenge, the robots are required to explore underground environments, which are challenging for communication systems. Teams in SubT Challenge mostly go with the deployable communication approach. Team NCTU also deploy communication nodes of our own design which are capable of mesh networking. One of the problem faced is when and how should we deploy a new node.
