### Abstract
In the recent years, ultra-wideband based (UWB) system has become increasingly popular for positioning especially in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. This is due to the unique RF characteristic of UWB where accurate range measurements can be obtained with time of arrival (ToA) method. This project seek to analyse the system as well as exploring its possible applications in DARPA Sub-terranean Challenge, where mobile robots are deployed into unknown environments for exploration.
